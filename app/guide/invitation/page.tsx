          Parthenon is the capstone hackathon of the Athena Award, Hack Club&apos;s most ambitious initiative to get girls technical. This hackathon weekend is the culmination of the Athena Award—empowering thousands of girls to build ambitious projects and code all year long. After coding for 30 hours and creating 3 technical projects, the top 200 girls internationally earn a spot at Parthenon in New York City to celebrate their hard work over the past few months.

What are the Athena Awards? 
The Athena Award is a six-month long program at Hack Club designed to
encourage girls and gender minorities to code and ‘ship’  technical projects.
The program itself, as part of the Athena Initiative, is aimed at and for high
school students worldwide. 

We aim for students who have completed the Athena Award to be technically proficient and confident members of their communities. Following their completion of the Awards, students should be at the stage where they work on personal projects outside of school, lead Hack Clubs/coding clubs, run hackathons and events in their areas, and overall, are more involved in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields.
