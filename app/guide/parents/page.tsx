        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          The Athena Award is a six-month long program at Hack Club designed to
          encourage girls and gender minorities to code and &quot;ship&quot;
          technical projects. The program itself, as part of the Athena
          Initiative, is aimed at and for high school students worldwide.

          We aim for students who have completed the Athena Award to be
          technically proficient and confident members of their communities.
          Following their completion of the Awards, students should be at the
          stage where they work on personal projects outside of school, lead
          Hack Clubs/coding clubs, run hackathons and events in their areas, and
          overall, are more involved in STEM fields.
        </p>

          Parthenon is the capstone hackathon of the Athena Award, Hack

          Participation in the event is entirely free, but there are
          requirements for entry that your child must meet. Without completing
          and receiving the Athena Award (our online engineering challenge),
          your child will not get an invite to Parthenon. We will cover expenses
          at the event for the entire three-day experience, including meals and
          activities. Participants are generally responsible for their own
          travel to New York City, but we are able to offer limited travel
          grants.
